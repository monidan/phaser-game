# Installation

Firstly, you need to have this repo on your PC. Clone it.

Then do following steps inside the folder of our game: 

1. `npm install` - install all dependencies which our game will need.

2. `npm run start` - this command will start our web-server where the game 
will be displayed. If it is not, so check the port on which the web-server is
being held. May be you will need to change it in our *package.json*.

3. Now simply go on the web-page which you parcel is shown to you in the
terminal.

**P.S.** If you have any issues, you know what to do. :)
